## How to use
It's simple. Install once and it will update your presence whenever you open an Adobe app. **_As long as the window of the program exists_**, it will do its job. Don't close the window.

## Installation
There are two options to install. The setup method is quick and effective.

### Automatic Setup
1. Download the installer from the Releases page, to the right. 
2. Run the installer and optionally add a Desktop shortcut for easy access.
   _Note: This program will be added to your user's startup folder so you don't have to open it every time._
3. Optionally reboot your PC or launch the app manually.

### Compile Yourself
1. Download the source code and extract it.
2. cd into the directory and run ``pyinstaller pyinstall.spec``. The final exe will be in the ``/dist/adoberpc`` folder.
